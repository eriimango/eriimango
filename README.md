Hi there 👋 I'm Ericka

🔭 I enjoy creating micro-applications and infusing everything with Gen AI.
📍 I’m working on C#, Swift/IOS development, Security+, and improving problem solving and development skills.
🌱 I’m looking to collaborate on anything having an impact.

🌟 Cool Fact: My first role out of college was at Amazon Web Services(AWS) as an SDE I on the S3 service side!
